# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

  # Admin User can login & add most other data via ActiveAdmin
  @user = User.new(:email => "user@codemontage.com", :password => "passw0rd")
  @user.is_admin = true
  @user.save!
