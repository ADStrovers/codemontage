###Development Environment Setup

CodeMontage currently uses Ruby on Rails version 3.2.6 and Postgres 9.1.4.

Get started by
* Installing Rails. We recommend [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org).
* Installing Postgres. We recommend [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com). 
  (If you're using Mac OS X Lion, you may need [this fix for Postgres](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9354122/how-to-install-postgresql-9-1-on-osx-lion).)
* Configure the app for your local database by copying *database.yml.sample* to *database.yml* and making any changes needed for your database setup.

Once you've installed these dependencies, test your setup by running $ 'rails server' and visiting the site at http://localhost:3000

Congratulations, you're ready to help build CodeMontage!
